## Capture funds with saferpay payment

### Step 1. Download paypal payum lib

Add the following lines in your `composer.json` file:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "payum/saferpay": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

_**Note:** You may want to adapt this line to use a specific version._

Now, run composer.phar to download the bundle:

```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```

_**Note:** You can immediately start using it. The autoloading files have been generated by composer and already included to the app autoload file._

### Step 2: Basic configuration.

#### 1. Configure payment context

```yml
#app/config/config.yml

payum:
    contexts:
        your_context_name:
            saferpay_payment:
                #TODO 
```

**Warning:**

> You have to changed this name `your_context_name` to something related to your domain, for example `post_a_job_with_paypal`
